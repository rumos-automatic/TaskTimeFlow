# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TaskTimeFlow is a next-generation task management SaaS that combines innovative 3-screen UI (Task Pool × Timeline × Focus) with complete Google Calendar/Tasks integration. It solves the problem of tasks piling up without execution by implementing timeboxing and Kanban fusion.

**Core Concept**: "Drag & drop task cards to timeline, sync with Google Calendar/Tasks for the ultimate timeboxing task management app"

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (BaaS) + Vercel Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime (WebSocket)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Global CDN)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Google Gemini (Edge APIs)
